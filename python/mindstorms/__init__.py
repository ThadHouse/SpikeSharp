        If left_speed or right_speed is outside of the allowed range, the value will be set to -100 or 100 depending whether the value is positive or negative.
        If one of the speed is negative (left_speed or right_speed), then the motor with that negative speed will run backward instead of forward. If the value of the amount parameter is negative, both motors will rotate backward instead of forward. If both the speed values (left_speed or right_speed) are negative and the value of the amount parameter is negative, then the both motors will rotate forward.
        The program will not continue until amount is reached.
